Browsergotchi is tiny hackathon project, bringing to your browser funny froggy widget you probably need to take care of.
Browsergotchi lives inside your Chrome; it becomes happy when you're visiting proper websites, and unhappy when you're procrastinating on some 9gagy stuff. You better look after it.

The project was brought to life by [@Pastew](https://github.com/Pastew) & [@ympek](https://github.com/ympek)
on BAIT (Best Automatics & IT Festival) Hackathon,
Krakow, Poland
17-18.12.2016
